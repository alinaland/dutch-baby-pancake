        This large, fluffy pancake is excellent for breakfast, brunch, lunch and
        dessert any time of year. And it comes together in about five blessed
        minutes. Just dump all of the ingredients into a blender, give it a good
        whirl, pour it into a heated skillet sizzling with butter, and pop it
        into the oven. Twenty-five minutes later? Bliss.

        This easy breakfast recipe yields impressive results. Simply whisk
        together eggs, flour and milk, then pour into a hot buttered skillet and
        place in the oven. Watch in amazement as the pancake rises out of the
        pan! The recipe can be made in one large skillet or two smaller ones.
        Make into a dessert by serving with cooked apples, peaches or other
        fruit.

        The next time your crew craves pancakes, serve something new and
        exciting: a Dutch baby. This baked pancake requires whirring a few basic
        ingredients in a blender, pouring the batter into a piping-hot skillet,
        and baking for 20 minutes (no need to flip). After it poofs up into a
        show-worthy display, serve with fresh fruit, whipped cream, and warm
        maple syrup.
