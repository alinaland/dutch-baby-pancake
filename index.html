      <h1>Dutch Baby Pancake</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Overview</strong> A Dutch baby pancake, sometimes called a
        German pancake, a Bismarck, a Dutch puff, or a Hootenanny, is a large
        American popover. A Dutch baby is similar to a large Yorkshire pudding.
        Unlike most pancakes, Dutch babies are baked in the oven, rather than
        being fried.
        <br />
        <strong>Name Origin</strong> The term “Dutch baby” was coined by an
        American restaurateur whose use of “Dutch” was a corruption of the word
        “Deutsch” (“German” in German). “Baby” referred to the fact that the
        restaurant served miniature versions.
        <br />
        <strong>Flavor</strong> It tastes like a custardy thick crepe with
        crispy croissant-like edges. It is buttery and eggy and not very sweet.
        I like to offset some of the egginess with a little extra vanilla and a
        fresh squeeze of lemon.
